Chrome extension to configure the same keyboard shorcuts for the llms i use daily. 
Works on chatgpt, grok, claude, perplexity and t3chat (only websites, no app)
Allows you to set the same hotkey for all webistes (example: set "cmd shift o" to open a new chat on all those websites, instead of having to memorize each one)
Configurable hotkeys on the options menu of the extension.
Feel free to fork, improve or add your own functionality.
To install it, download it with git clone, go to "chrome://extensions", enable developer mode and hit "load unpacked".
